1. What is the need of IAM?
 IAM is a fundamental service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that allows you to manage access to AWS resources securely.IAM can manage policies and permission to the users and groups and it can add/delete the users and groups.
 
2.If i am a non tech person, how will you define policies in IAM?
policies are set of rules and regulations.for example you line in a apartment building but you can acess only to room no307 and you can do everything you want. but you are not acess into another rooms.

3.Please define a scenerio in which you would like to create your on own IAM policy.
suppose one group need the s3 bucket for the duration of 4 month , after that they dont need , so i need to delete the policy

4.Why do we prefer not using root account?
The root account has unrestricted access to all AWS resources and services. If the root account credentials are compromised, an attacker would have complete control over your entire AWS infrastructure. 

5.How to revoke policy for an IAM user?
goto the iam dashboard select the user in user unselect the policy for already selected.

6.Can a single IAM user be a part of multiple policy via group and root? how?
root user have all the acess to the aws resources btter not to use the root account for everyday task.
IAM user can be a part of different groups , so diffrent have different policies  also.
IAM user have also different policies and permission attached by the root user.
